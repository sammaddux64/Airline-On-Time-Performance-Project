# Airline On-Time Performance Project

## Project Description

In this project, my team and I focused on assessing the performance of airlines during the calendar year of 2020. We began by downloading data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) related to airline on-time performance. Our goal was to analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the operations of different airlines.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Download & Upload**: We downloaded the dataset from BTS and uploaded it to Tableau for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: 
   - To clean the data, we applied a **left join** between the main dataset and several specific **lookup tables**. This allowed us to eliminate **null values** that could have obscured our analysis. By ensuring that every relevant field was filled with appropriate data, we were able to retain valuable information that would have otherwise been lost.
   - Additionally, we used **calculated fields** to further process and create new insights from the data. These fields enabled us to compute metrics such as on-time performance rates, cancellations, delays, and more.
3. **Performance Metrics**: We identified multiple performance metrics to assess on-time performance across various airlines.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using Tableau, we created several visualizations to illustrate the findings.
5. **Analysis**: We analyzed the data and visualizations to uncover interesting insights, especially focusing on the impact of the pandemic on airline operations.

By the end of the project, we were able to draw meaningful conclusions on how different airlines adapted to the challenges posed by the pandemic.
